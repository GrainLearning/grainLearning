Welcome to GrainLearning's documentation!
=========================================

GrainLearning is a Bayesian uncertainty quantification and propagation toolbox for computer simulations
of granular materials.
The software is primarily used to infer and quantify parameter uncertainties in computational models of granular materials
from observation data, which is also known as inverse analyses or data assimilation. 
Implemented in Python, GrainLearning can be loaded into a Python environment to process the simulation and observation data,
or alternatively, as an independent tool where simulation runs are done separately, e.g., via a shell script.
