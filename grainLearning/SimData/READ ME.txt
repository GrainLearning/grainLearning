The values expressed in the file's name are (in order):
-Particle dispersity, range [1.2, 10];
-Loading stiffness, range [1e2, 5e3];
-Relative tangential stiffness, range [0, 1];
-Sliding friction, range [0, 0.3].
In addition to those files there are two more files:
-Target_Stress.txt: target values of the problem;
-Void_Index: values in which the stress is mesured.
