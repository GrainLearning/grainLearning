# Description

GrainLearning is a Python-based **Bayesian Calibration** tool for estimating parameter uncertainties
in geomechanical models (currently only particle-scale and elasto-plasticity models are tested).
It uses the [recursive Bayes' rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_Bayesian_estimation)
to quantify the evolution of the probability distribution of parameters over time or a load history.
Samples are drawn either uniformly, assuming no prior knowledge, or a proposal distribution that is iteratively learned.
After having enough statistics per iteration ([_effective sample size_](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1008935410038)),
We train and utilize **nonparametric Gaussian mixture** models as proposal distributions to resample our parameter space.
The mixture model trained at the _end of each iteration_ guides the resampling
to be asymptotically close to global optima, 
and thus greatly reduces the computational cost compared with [conventional approaches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_filter). 

GrainLearning is developed to serve the ever-increasing need for fast and accurate estimation
of particle- or microstructure-scale parameters in **discrete element method (DEM)** simulations of granular materials.
For that purpose, GrainLearning is implemented to work seamlessly with **Yade**, an open-source discrete numerical modeling framework.
However, integrating GrainLearning with other codes
(e.g., [MercuryDPM](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010465519304357) and methods *not limited to DEM*)
is rather straight forward.
One could either pass parameter samples generated by GrainLearning from Python to (the executable of) your model
or implement your own [runModel](https://github.com/chyalexcheng/grainLearning/blob/master/grainLearning/YadeSim.py) module in Python.

# Introduction

In particle simulations, plastic deformation at the macro scale arises from contact sliding in the tangential and rolling/twisting directions and the irrecoverable change of the microstructure.
Because the parameters relevant to these microscopic phenomena are not directly measurable in a laboratory, calibration of DEM models is generally treated as an inverse problem using "inverse methods", ranging from trial and error to sophisticated statistical inference.
Solving an inverse problem that involves nonlinearity and/or discontinuity in the *forward* model (DEM) is very challenging.
Furthermore, because of the potentially large computational cost for running the simulations, the "trials" have to be selected with an optimized strategy to boost the efficiency.

In GrainLearning, the probability distribution of model states and parameters, conditioned on given reference data (termed "posterior distribution") can be approximated by sequential Monte Carlo methods.
To efficiently sample parameter space, a multi-level (re)sampling algorithm is utilized.
For the first iteration of Bayesian filtering, the parameter values are uniformly sampled from quasi-random numbers, which leads to conventional sequential quasi-Monte Carlo (SQMC) filtering.
For the subsequent iterations, new parameter values are drawn from the posterior distribution updated by the previous iteration.
Iterative Bayesian filtering allows us to sample near potential posterior modes in parameter space, with an increasing sample density over the iterations, until the ensemble predictions of the model parameters converge.

## Bayesian filtering
The aim of Bayesian filtering is to estimate the probability distribution of the augmented model state that consist of parameters (assuming they vary in time) and model prediction <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\inline&space;\hat{\vec{x}}_t=(\vec{x}_t,&space;\vec{\Theta}_t)" title="\hat{\vec{x}}_t=(\vec{x}_t, \vec{\Theta}_t)" />, conditioned on all available data <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\inline&space;\vec{y}_{1:t}" title="\vec{y}_{1:t}" />.
From this conditional probability (termed "posterior") distribution, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\inline&space;p(\hat{\vec{x}}_t|\vec{y}_{1:t})" title="p(\hat{\vec{x}}_t|\vec{y}_{1:t})" />, the moments such as the means and variances can be computed as 
 
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\mathrm{\widehat{E}}[f_t(\hat{\vec{x}}_t)|\vec{y}_{1:t}]&space;=&space;\sum_{i=1}^{N_p}&space;w_t^{(i)}&space;f_t(\hat{\vec{x}}_t^{(i)})" title="\mathrm{\widehat{E}}[f_t(\hat{\vec{x}}_t)|\vec{y}_{1:t}] = \sum_{i=1}^{N_p} w_t^{(i)} f_t(\hat{\vec{x}}_t^{(i)})" />
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\mathrm{\widehat{Var}}[f_t(\hat{\vec{x}}_t)|\vec{y}_{1:t}]&space;=&space;\sum_{i=1}^{N_p}&space;w_t^{(i)}&space;(f_t(\hat{\vec{x}}_t^{(i)})-\mathrm{\widehat{E}}[f_t(\hat{\vec{x}}_t)|\vec{y}_{1:t}])^2" title="\mathrm{\widehat{Var}}[f_t(\hat{\vec{x}}_t)|\vec{y}_{1:t}] = \sum_{i=1}^{N_p} w_t^{(i)} (f_t(\hat{\vec{x}}_t^{(i)})-\mathrm{\widehat{E}}[f_t(\hat{\vec{x}}_t)|\vec{y}_{1:t}])^2" />

where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?f_t" title="f_t" /> describes an arbitrary quantity of interest as a function of the augmented model state, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?N_p" title="N_p" /> is the number of samples drawn from a proposal distribution.
Each sample is associated with an importance weight that corrects the Monte Carlo approximation of the full posterior distribution <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?f_t(\hat{\vec{x}}_{0:t})|\vec{y}_{1:t}" title="f_t(\hat{\vec{x}}_{0:t})|\vec{y}_{1:t}" /> from the proposal distribution, using the recursive Bayes' rule.
Note that the importance weights <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\{w_t^{(i)};&space;i&space;=&space;1,\dots,N_p\}" title="\{w_t^{(i)}; i = 1,\dots,N_p\}" /> are normalized to sum to unity at each time step.

## Iterative sampling using nonparametric Gaussian mixtures

Because the posterior distribution of the model parameters is typically unknown, a non-informative proposal density is used to uniformly explore the parameter space in the first iteration (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?k=0" title="k=0" />).
The sampling is done with quasi-random numbers (defined an initial guess of the upper and lower bounds of parameters), which leads to the so-called sequential quasi-Monte Carlo (SQMC) filter with an number of samples scales with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?d\log{d}" title="d\log{d}" />.
Although a uniform initial sampling is unbiased, it is very inefficient and ensured to degenerate as time approaches infinity.
To avoid circumvent weight degeneracy, the inverse problem is solved again from time *0* to *T* with new samples drawn from a more sensible proposal distribution and reinitialized weights.

The posterior distribution of the parameters resulting from the previous Bayesian filtering <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?p_{k-1}(\vec{\Theta}|\vec{y}_{1:T})" title="p_{k-1}(\vec{\Theta}|\vec{y}_{1:T})" /> is chosen as the proposal distribution; the parameter samples <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\vec{\Theta}^{(i)}" title="\vec{\Theta}^{(i)}" /> are drawn from
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?p_{k-1}(\vec{\Theta}|\vec{y}_{1:T})" title="p_{k-1}(\vec{\Theta}|\vec{y}_{1:T})" />.
For each iteration with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?k>0" title="k>0" />, the proposal density is constructed by training a nonparametric Gaussian mixture with the samples and importance weights from the previous iteration.
Because the closer to a posterior distribution mode the higher the sample density, resampling from the repeatedly updated proposal density allows to zoom into highly probable parameter subspace in very few iterations.
The iterative (re)sampling scheme brings three major advantages to the Bayesian filtering framework:

 1. The posterior distribution is iteratively estimated with an increasing resolution on the posterior landscape.
 2. The multi-level sampling algorithm keeps allocating model evaluations in parameter subspace where the posterior probabilities are expected to be high, thus significantly improving computational efficiency.
 3. Resampling that takes place between two consecutive iterations can effectively overcome weight degeneracy problem while keeping sample trajectories intact within the time/load history.

# Code and data structure

## The SMC class

## Capabilities

## Data directories and formatting

## Reference or observation data

GrainLearning stores your reference/observation data as a dictionary-type variable in the class `smc`.
Therefore, the user needs to provide the keys to the data sequence for the _control_ and _output_ of a model evaluation
(e.g., axial strain and axial stress in a triaxial test).
These two (lists of) keys are used to extract the corresponding datasets from the data file of a model evaluation.
 
    # key for simulation control
    obsCtrl = 'u'
    # key for output data
    simDataKeys = ['f']

# Tutorials

The tutorials are provided with the goal to work with or post-process simulation data from **Yade**.
_Model evaluations_ here are therefore the evaluations of a Yade-DEM model.
In the case of DEM modeling of granular soils, relevant parameters could be
Young's modulus, friction coefficient, Poisson's ratio, rolling stiffness, and rolling friction, etc.
of a soil particle, as well as structural parameters like a particle size distribution parameterized by its moments.
In the following, we will walk you through the steps of Bayesian calibration using GrainLearning.
The DEM model here is kept as simple as possible such that the calibration should finish within a few minutes on a normal laptop.

## Two-particle collision in the normal direction

For the sake of brevity, we shall first use the simplest DEM simulation,
i.e., two particles colliding in the normal direction,
described by the [**Hertz-Mindlin contact law**](https://yade-dem.org/doc/yade.wrapper.html?highlight=mindlin#yade.wrapper.Ip2_FrictMat_FrictMat_MindlinPhys).
Assuming perfectly elastic collision, the number of parameters reduces to only two,
namely, particle-scale Young's modulus $E$ and Poisson's ratio $\nu$ (weak dependency).
In the following, we will demonstrate the capability of GrainLearning using such a simple DEM model.
The tutorial [CaliCollision.py](https://github.com/chyalexcheng/grainLearning/blob/master/grainLearning/CaliCollision.py) is set up as follows.

 1. Create a synthetic dataset from the "two-particle" simulation (already in [GrainLearning/collision.dat](https://github.com/chyalexcheng/grainLearning/blob/master/grainLearning/collision.dat)) as the ground truth
 
        ObsData = np.loadtxt('collision.dat')
 2. Add Gaussian noise to the ground truth
        
        noise = np.random.normal(0, 0.1 * max(ObsData[1]), len(ObsData[1]))
 3. Run GrainLearning iteratively until the error is sufficiently small and see if the correct parameter values are recovered

        # iterate the problem
        while smcTest.sigma > 1.0e-2 and iterNO < maxNumOfIters:
            # initialize the weights
            smcTest.initialize(maxNumComponents, priorWeight, covType=covType)
            # run sequential Monte Carlo
            ips, covs = smcTest.run(iterNO=iterNO)

### The driver script

To run the tutorial execute the driver script 'CaliCollision.py'

    ipython3 CaliCollision.py

You will then be asked to give your initial guess of the upper limit of the **normalized covariance** $\sigma$.
You could think of $\sigma$ as the error between the ground truth and your model prediction which could be 100% or even larger.
In fact, GrainLearning tries to find the $\sigma$ that results in an effective sample size equal to a user-specified value,
via the _root-finding algorithm_ of the scipy library.

    # user-defined parameter: upper limit of the normalized covariance coefficient
    sigma = float(input("Give an initial guess of the upper limit of normalized covariance: "))
    # target effective sample size specified by the user
    ess = 0.3
    obsWeights = [1.0]

Before entering the iteration loop of Bayesian filtering,
provide the names of the unknown parameters and their upper and lower limits.
They will be used only in the **first iteration** for generating uniformly distributed parameter samples,
using the low-discrepancy sequence of [Ghalton](https://ghalton.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
(see the advantage of low-discrepancy sequences over random numbers in [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-discrepancy_sequence)).

    # give ranges of parameter values (E, \nu)
    paramNames = ['E', 'nu']
    numParams = len(paramNames)
    # use uniform sampling for the first iteration
    paramRanges = {'E': [10e9, 100e9], 'nu': [0.1, 0.5]}

For **iterations after the first**, parameter samples are drawn from the Gaussian mixture model
that is trained at the end of the previous iteration.
Although the Gaussian mixture model used here is nonparametric, it still requires hyper-parameters
which are rough estimates of what the values of the actual parameters should be
(e.g., the maximum number of Gaussian components is a parameter which itself is estimated during the training).
For the technical details on the maximum of Gaussian components and the prior weight (weight_concentration_prior),
see the documentation of the [BayesianGaussinMixture](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.mixture.BayesianGaussianMixture.html) class of scikit-learn.
For demonstration purpose, we choose 10 for the sample size of a 1D problem (one unknown parameter)
which in our experience seems to be enough to give reasonable results.

    # set number of samples per iteration (e.g., num1D * N * logN for quasi-Sequential Monte Carlo)
    numSamples1D = 10  
    numSamples = int(numSamples1D * numParams * log(numParams))
    # set the maximum Gaussian components and prior weight
    maxNumComponents = int(numSamples / 10)
    priorWeight = 1. / maxNumComponents
    covType = 'tied'

GrainLearning can be used in _two different ways_:

1. **Interactive modes** that allows iterative Bayesian calibration, with

    1.1. Yade fully integrated with GrainLearning in a Python environment (import Yade as a Python library)

    1.2. Yade-batch jobs sent from Python to the command line and the data read into GrainLearning after simulations are finished

2. **Stand-alone mode** that only generates samples or post-processes pre-run simulation data to obtain parameter distributions  

The following subsections will demonstrate the usage of two interactive and one stand-alone mode.
Note that for evaluating numerical models other than Yade-DEM, one could use either the **interactive mode**
with the model run outside Python or the **stand-alone mode** that handles one iteration at a time.

## Two interactive modes

### Mode I: Run model evaluations (DEM) within GrainLearning (Python)

The most efficient way of using GrainLearning is to wrap everything within a Python environment.
This allows keeping all simulation data in memory without the necessity of writing and reading them externally,
and thus less prone to errors like not matching parameter samples and simulation data.
To our knowledge, this interactive mode is currently only possible with Yade.
Furthermore, a unified Python environment also allows the possibility to synchronize Bayesian calibration and Yade in time,
which means the user could pause the calibration at certain times, take a look at the probability distribution of parameters,
see whether the statistics converge or not, and then decide on whether proceed in time or jump directly to the resampling step.

This interactive mode can be switched on simply by setting the variables `runYadeInGL=True` and `standAlone=False`. 

    # interactive mode with Yade running inside GrainLearning
    smcTest = smc(sigma, ess, obsWeights,
                  obsCtrl=obsCtrl, simDataKeys=simDataKeys, obsFileName='collisionObs.dat',
                  loadSamples=False, runYadeInGL=True, standAlone=False)

    # generate the initial parameter samples with a low-discrepancy sequence
    smcTest.initParams(paramNames, paramRanges, numSamples)

In order to use Yade within GrainLearning, some modification has to be made on the Yade side.
* Load Yade as a Python library. See details in [here](https://yade-dem.org/doc/user.html?highlight=yadeimport#importing-yade-in-other-python-applications)

        # yadeimport.py is generated by `ln yade-versionNo yadeimport.py`
        # add the directory where Yade is install
        sys.path.append(<directory where Yade is installed>)
        # import external dependencies
        from yadeimport import *

* Convert a Yade driver script (e.g., [Collision.py](https://github.com/chyalexcheng/grainLearning/blob/master/grainLearning/Collision.py))
to functions ([YadeSim.py](https://github.com/chyalexcheng/grainLearning/blob/master/grainLearning/YadeSim.py))
that can be accessed from GrainLearning and managed by the multiprocessing module of Python

### Mode II: Run model evaluations (DEM) outside GrainLearning (Python)

Perhaps, this interactive mode is the easiest way to use GrainLearning and Yade (or other numerical models) together.
The steps to do this include

1. create a parameter table from GrainLearning,
2. run Yade in batch mode using the table,
3. and return to GrainLearning once the simulations are finished.

This is essentially the stand-alone mode plus Python sending Yade-batch jobs to the command line.
Note for non-Yade users step 2 can be replaced by a string
that can execute the model evaluations using the parameter table.
 
To switch on this interactive mode, simply set `runYadeInGL=False` and `standAlone=False`.
Of course, the user has to provide the Yade script which in our case is `yadeScript='Collision.py'`,
the directory where the simulation data is stored `yadeDataDir='Collision'`,
and the Yade command, e.g., `yadeVersion='yade-batch'`.
`simName` should also be provided to make the search for simulation data in `yadeDataDir` easier.

    # interactive mode with Yade running outside GrainLearning
    smcTest = smc(sigma, ess, obsWeights,
                  yadeVersion='yadedaily-batch', yadeScript='Collision.py', yadeDataDir='Collision', threads=threads,
                  obsCtrl=obsCtrl, simDataKeys=simDataKeys, simName='2particle', obsFileName='collisionObs.dat',
                  loadSamples=False, runYadeInGL=False, standAlone=False)

    # generate the initial parameter samples with a low-discrepancy sequence
    smcTest.initParams(paramNames, paramRanges, numSamples)

### Start iterative Bayesian calibration with a user-defined parameter table

The previous two sections assume that you have no prior knowledge of the probability distribution of the parameters;
you would like to start from a state of ignorance, i.e., uniform sampling.
However, if you have some prior knowledge,
you might want to start iterative Bayesian calibration with your own parameter samples that are not drawn uniformly.
Such samples can be drawn either from a distribution provided externally by another software or from the previous runs of GrainLearning.
We call the distribution from which these samples are drawn a **proposal distribution**.
In fact, the key to Bayesian calibration is how the proposal distribution is chosen such that
it approximates (at least part of) the probability landscape over your model parameters, conditioned on your reference/observation data.

To start off with parameter samples known _a-priori_, you only need the following two things:
1. Turn the flag `loadSamples=True` when creating the smc object.
You could use either interactive mode I or II, depending on whether your model can be evaluated within GrainLearning (Python).

        # interactive mode with Yade running inside GrainLearning
        smcTest = smc(sigma, ess, obsWeights,
                      yadeDataDir='Collision', threads=threads,
                      obsCtrl=obsCtrl, simDataKeys=simDataKeys, obsFileName='collisionObs.dat',
                      loadSamples=True, runYadeInGL=True, standAlone=False)

    or

        # interactive mode with Yade running outside GrainLearning
        smcTest = smc(sigma, ess, obsWeights,
                      yadeVersion='yadedaily-batch', yadeScript='Collision.py', yadeDataDir='Collision', threads=threads,
                      obsCtrl=obsCtrl, simDataKeys=simDataKeys, simName='2particle', obsFileName='collisionObs.dat',
                      loadSamples=True, runYadeInGL=False, standAlone=False)

2. Specify the text file where your parameter samples are or will be stored `paramsFile='<File name of the parameter table>.txt'`.
       
        # load the initial parameter samples externally 
        smcTest.initParams(paramNames, paramRanges, numSamples, paramsFile='smcTableUser.txt')

#### What if I have already obtained simulation data using my own parameter samples? 

If the simulation data are already available, you surely do not want to redo the calculations.
What you can do is to temporarily switch to the _stand-alone mode_, only for the first iteration,
and then switch back to one of the interactive modes after the first iteration is finished.
The rest is the same as in either interactive mode.
Fortunately, we already implement the switch between interactive and stand-alone modes, depending on
whether simulation data are available in a user-defined subdirectory under `smc.yadeDataDir`.
All you need to do is specify the name of that subdirectory `subDir` when initializing parameter samples.

    # load the initial parameter samples externally
    smcTest.initParams(paramNames, paramRanges, numSamples, paramsFile='smcTableUser.txt', subDir='iter0')

It is crucial to ensure that
the simulation data read in from the files in `subDir` match correctly with the parameter samples in `paramsFile`.
Whether they match or not is checked in the member function `checkParamsError()` of the `smc` class.
In order to make `smc.checkParamsError()` work, your data files will **have to be named** as
`<simName>_<key>_<param0>_<param1>_..._<paramN>.txt`,
where the simulation name, NO. of model evaluation, and parameter values are kept in the file name.
We ask the user to follow this convention so that GrainLearning can check this potential error,
and recover your parameter samples even if your parameter table is lost or overwritten.

#### Extract parameter samples from the names of simulation files

If your parameter table is indeed lost or overwritten accidentally,
GrainLearning can still extract the parameter samples from the names of your data files.
The extracted parameter samples will be saved in the file `paramsFile` that was not there before running GrainLearning.
The default name `'TableFromFileNames.txt'` will be used if you do not specify `paramsFile` explicitly.

    # load the initial parameter samples externally
    smcTest.initParams(paramNames, paramRanges, numSamples, paramsFile='smcTableUser.txt', subDir='iter0')

The search for simulation data files could be unsuccessful when `simName` is set incorrectly. 
You will be asked to update the `simName` interactively in the function `smc.getYadeDataFiles()`
until the data files are foun.

## Stand-alone mode

As mentioned before, the stand-alone mode handles one iteration at a time.
In this mode, you can skip model evaluations if you only wish to create an initial set of uniformly distributed samples.
You can also use GrainLearning as a post-process tool to estimate parameter distribution using pre-run simulation data stored in `subDir`.

### Create an initial set of uniformly distributed samples 

To generate an initial set of samples using a low-discrepancy sequence, you only need the code pieces before the iteration loop.
The relevant flags are `loadSamples=False` and `standAlone=True`.
After `smc.initParams(...)`, an initial parameter table named `smcTable0.txt` will be created.

    # generate the initial parameter samples with a low-discrepancy sequence
    smcTest.initParams(paramNames, paramRanges, numSamples)

### Use GrainLearning as a post-processing tool

To get a feeling of the stand-alone mode, use the script `CaliCollision_StandAlone.py`
which is shortened from `CaliCollision.py` without the loop of iterative Bayesian filtering.
Differently from the subsection above, one would need to set `loadSamples=True` and specify the parameter table and data subdirectory,
in order to proceed until the resampling step. 

    # stand-alone mode: use GrainLearning as a post-process tool using pre-run DEM data
    smcTest = smc(sigma, ess, obsWeights,
                  yadeDataDir='Collision', threads=threads,
                  obsCtrl=obsCtrl, simDataKeys=simDataKeys, simName='2particle', obsFileName='collisionObs.dat',
                  loadSamples=True, runYadeInGL=False, standAlone=True)
    
    # load or generate the initial parameter samples
    smcTest.initParams(paramNames, paramRanges, numSamples, paramsFile='smcTable%i.txt' % iterNO, subDir='iter%i' % iterNO)

## Oedometric compression of granular materials in a periodic box

Another example of the stand-alone mode is the calibration of oedometric compression.
Pre-run simulation data are stored in the subdirectories of "Oedometric" and the trained proposal densities saved in the pickle format.
You might want to take a look at this tutorial and get a feeling of iterative Bayesian calibration in action.
The sample size 100 is sufficient for four unknown parameters, which could be a bit conservative.
In fact, it is difficult to determine an appropriate sample size.
The optimal sample size is problem-dependent and limited by the resources you have at disposal.
We are eager to know your experience gained for your particular problems.
